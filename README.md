# CommandLineCalculator

This simple project was the last assignment for computer systems programming class. It require the us to make use of structs to create a 
menu based command line calculator. It allows you to add, subtract, divide, multiply, modulo, and reverse the input that is placed in to 
the command line. 

How the Program works

When you start the program from the command line you will need to enter in all the arguments you wish to calculate seperated by spaces.
The program will then show a menu with the different choices available, and prompt the user to enter in their choice. It will then display
the calculation the user chose and show the results of the calculations from left to right. The program will continue to run until the
enters in a 0 which will exit the program.
